                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>Event hosts struggle with using multiple applications (Google Forms, Google Sheets, Partiful) to manage budgeting, collect dietary restrictions, and consider suitable caterers, creating friction and health risks when it comes to event planning.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box success">
                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                    <p>A unified web application that streamlines planning, collects guest data, and provides data analysis for budgeting and dietary accommodations.</p>
                </div>

                <p>As Project Lead and Lead UX Designer, I guided our team through the iterative design process to create EventGenie—a platform that reduces app fatigue and empowers event hosts to plan with confidence.</p>

            <!-- Design Strategy Section -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Design Strategy</h2>
                <p>Based on our research insights, we translated user pain points into actionable design goals and features.</p>

                <h3>User Goals</h3>
                <p>We defined three core goals based on user needs:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Plan an event within a budget range</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Analyze budget and user trends</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Connect with local food providers and arrange catering</strong></li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Problem Scenarios</h3>
                <p>We developed scenarios to frame the core problem, such as:</p>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Jessica, Front Desk Attendant:</strong> Spends hours toggling between Google Suite apps to collect dietary restrictions, check budgets in spreadsheets, and search Yelp for caterers while constantly worrying about missing a critical allergy</p>
                </div>

                <h3>How Might We Statements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HMW</strong> design app navigation that is natural and effortless for users of all ages and technical skills?</li>
                    <li><strong>HMW</strong> allow users to quickly find affordable suppliers for their food?</li>
                    <li><strong>HMW</strong> allow users to communicate with food suppliers more easily, especially with language barriers present?</li>

            <!-- Architecture & Prototyping Section -->
            <section class="content-section" style="margin-top: calc(-1 * var(--spacing-lg));">
                <h2>Architecture & Prototyping</h2>
                <p>We transitioned from abstract concepts to testable prototypes through careful information architecture and user flow mapping.</p>

                <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
                <p>We established a clear core structure for the application:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Home</strong> → Dashboard with quick access to key features</li>
                    <li><strong>Explore Restaurants</strong> → Browse and vet catering options</li>
                    <li><strong>Events</strong> → Manage current and upcoming events</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Analysis</strong> → Budget tracking and dietary trends</li>
                    <li><strong>Profile</strong> → User settings and preferences</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>User Flows</h3>
                <p>We mapped detailed flows for critical tasks, such as <strong>"Plan an event within a budget range"</strong> which moves through:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sign-up / Login</li>
                    <li>Create new event</li>
                    <li>Set budget parameters</li>
                    <li>Review suitable caterers</li>
                    <li>Contact and arrange catering</li>
                </ol>

                    <p class="image-caption">User flow for planning an event within budget</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Concept Sketches</h3>
                <p>We used rough sketches to quickly explore multiple design directions and establish core layouts, including the Home screen layout with Events, Forms, and Restaurants sections.</p>

                <div class="project-image-section">

                </div>

                <h3>Paper Prototype</h3>
                <p>We then refined our concepts into paper prototype screens to test navigation flows and interactions before moving to digital wireframes. These low-fidelity prototypes allowed us to validate our design decisions quickly and cost-effectively.</p>
                <p>Below are video walkthroughs demonstrating how users would complete each of our three core user goals:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prioritizing Discovery:</strong> Thorough user research allowed for my team and I to deeply understand the problem we are trying to solve prior to focusing on solutions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mitigating Bias:</strong>Detailed research helped us in recognizing and addressing personal biases during the design process, a crucial action to ensure our app genuinely solved the hosts' complex planning needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Iterative process:</strong>Engaging with the full design process and seeing where artifacts fit into tho the Double Diamond model increased my confidence as a designer due to the success of creating an effective and inclusive design.</li>
