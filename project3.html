                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This individual research study utilized a 7-day diary method with 20 participants to capture the context of user media consumption. The project demonstrates advanced qualitative research skills, from study design through data synthesis and presentation.</p>
                <p>By capturing real-time insights into how, when, and why people consume media, this study reveals nuanced patterns that traditional retrospective interviews might miss.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Research Design</h2>
                <p>Using a supplied study protocol, I executed a 7-day diary study to understand media consumption behavior in natural contexts over time.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>Research Questions</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What types of media do people consume throughout their day?</li>
                        <li>What contextual factors influence media choices?</li>
                        <li>How do media consumption patterns vary across different situations?</li>
                        <li>What emotional and social needs does media consumption fulfill?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <p>Participants were asked to log each media consumption instance over 7 days, recording:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Date and Time</li>
                    <li>Type of media (video, music, social media, news, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Physical location and social context</li>
                    <li>Emotional state before and after</li>
                    <li>Reason for consuming that particular media</li>

            <!-- Analysis Process -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Qualitative Analysis</h2>
                <p>I employed multiple qualitative analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights from the diary data:</p>

                <h3>Affinity Mapping</h3>
                <p>I organized all diary entries into groups based on emerging patterns and themes using affinity diagrams. This bottom-up approach (open/closed coding) involved creating categories from half the dataset and then sorting the remaining entries into those categories. The analysis produced four affinity diagrams, each corresponding to a different section of the diary entry.</p>
                <p>Note: during analysis the affinity diagram titled “Reasons for Consuming Media” was omitted from synthesis because a majority of its items were vague, ambiguous, or miscellaneous and did not provide actionable insight. Omitting those entries preserved the richness of the remaining categories and helped maintain clear, interpretable patterns in the data.</p>

                <h3>Thematic Analysis</h3>
                <p>Synthesis of the affinity diagrams and the two empathy maps revealed three primary themes that characterize students' media consumption across contexts and time:</p>
                <h4>Self-improvement</h4>
                <p>Students often used media intentionally for learning, productivity, and personal growth. Entries tied to this theme included watching tutorials, listening to educational podcasts, reading articles or books for academic or practical purposes, and using media to support habits or study routines. Religious texts also appeared under this theme when used for reflection. This shows media serving as a tool for skill development and self-directed learning, not just entertainment.</p>

                <h4>Shared experiences & support</h4>
                <p>Media frequently functions as a social connector: students shared, recommended, or consumed media together with peers, family, or groups (co-viewing, group chats, practice playlists for team activities). Music and videos were sometimes integrated into social or team routines (e.g., choreography practice). This theme highlights media's role in building community, reinforcing relationships, and creating shared moments.</p>

                <h4>Doomscrolling (passive, habitual consumption)</h4>
                <p>A recurring pattern was passive, repetitive use of social feeds and short-form content to pass time, relieve boredom, or procrastinate. Language in the diaries—"to pass the time," "I was bored," or "habit"—points to disengaged, automatic use that often displaced more intentional activities. This pattern aligns with what is commonly described as "doomscrolling": prolonged, aimless consumption that can negatively affect mood and attention.</p>

                <h3>Empathy Mapping</h3>
                <p>I synthesized findings into empathy maps to capture participants' thoughts, feelings, actions, and pain points around media consumption. In addition to the affinity diagrams, two participants’ diary datasets were selected and translated into empathy maps to provide a more in-depth understanding of individual student experiences and motivations within the study.</p>

                    <div class="feature-item">
                        <h4>Context is central</h4>
                        <p>Time of day, location, and social context strongly shape the types of media students consume and the reasons they choose them.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-item">
                        <h4>Intentional vs. habitual use</h4>
                        <p>Media is used both intentionally (learning, task-focused consumption) and habitually (background listening, doomscrolling); these modes co-exist and often compete for attention.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-item">
                        <h4>Social and emotional functions</h4>
                        <p>Students use media to connect, share experiences, and provide emotional support as well as to regulate mood or pass time.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-item">
                        <h4>Platform & format mix</h4>
                        <p>Short-form social content and streaming video dominate frequency counts, while long-form and physical media appear less often but represent deeper engagement when used.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Behavioral Patterns</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Peak media consumption occurs in the evening (roughly 8pm–12am), aligning with streaming and social platforms.</li>
                    <li>Morning and daytime entries skew toward informational and task-related media (articles, podcasts, music) that fit academic or multitasking contexts.</li>
                    <li>Private, at-home contexts favor relaxation, routine, and enjoyment; transit or waiting contexts favor passing time and distraction.</li>
                    <li>Students fluidly switch between platforms and between high- and low-engagement media depending on time, task, and social situation.</li>

                <h2>Methodology Reflection</h2>
                <p>Conducting this diary study taught me valuable lessons about qualitative research:</p>

                <h3>Strengths of Diary Studies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Captures in-the-moment experiences, reducing recall bias</li>
                    <li>Reveals patterns over time that single-session research might miss</li>
                    <li>Provides rich contextual data about real-world behavior</li>
                    <li>Less researcher presence reduces observer effect</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Participation fatigue:</strong> Kept forms short and sent encouraging reminders</li>
                    <li><strong>Data volume:</strong> Used systematic coding and analysis frameworks</li>
                    <li><strong>Incomplete entries:</strong> Followed up with clarifying questions</li>
                    <li><strong>Synthesis complexity:</strong> Employed multiple analysis methods for triangulation</li>
